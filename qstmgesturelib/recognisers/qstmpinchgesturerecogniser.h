 * It seems that in capacitive touch in Symbian 9.4 touching with two
 * fingers causes fast EDrag events which are far from each other.

 * to determine when the gestures looks like a pinch.
 * Would requires a lot of tuning to be really useful, if at all possible.
 * With current implementation it is easy to zoom in but
 * almost impossible to zoom out.
