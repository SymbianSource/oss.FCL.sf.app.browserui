- Patch to remove build warnings. Code drop from Robert Katta.

Feburary 25, 2010:
- Updated code-drop from Robert Katta
- The fast allocator version currently in cwrt trunk is the latest ‘good’ one for the purpose
of integration with cWRT for ninetwo.
However, there was a memory optimisation applied to the implementation of FHA in S60 webkit:
decommitting pages that are in the middle of larger free cells in the Doug Lea arena,
and recommitting them if required for allocation. This was shown to free significant amounts of
unused RAM in the S60 WRT when widgets are started and stopped (as in several MB) that would
otherwise be tied into the heap. So, this updated code base is a merge of the ‘S60 webkit’ version
(extra memory optimisations) with the ‘Qt’ version (instantiation & tracing).
