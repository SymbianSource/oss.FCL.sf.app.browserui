	<h3>Bedrock Browser<br>Alpha 3<br>Release Notes</h3>
	</center>
	<br/>
	<br/><em>Updated: 15-Mar-2010</em>
	<p>
	<b>Note:</b> This version of the release notes is current for the software 
	that was packaged at release time. 
	For the latest release notes, visit the Browser Team's Wiki pages.
	</p>

	<h4>Overview</h4>
	The Bedrock Browser is Nokia's newest web browser.  It is based on the latest open-source WebKit 
	engine, and built using the Qt application framework.
	<p/>
	The Bedrock project's mission is to provide a fast, easy-to-use, standards-based browser 
	that competes with the best of today's mobile browsers.
	<p/>
	In addition to providing basic browser functionality, 
	Bedrock allows for almost infinite extensibility by utilizing an HTML/CSS/JavaScript UI 
	(User Interface) framework called "Ginebra".
	<p/>
	All of the UI components you see in the Bedrock Browser are rendered using Ginebra.  
	The UI can be modified as easily as modifying a web page.
	<p/>
	<HR>
	<h4>About this Release</h4>
	This is the Alpha 3 release of Bedrock. This release has been enhanced since the Alpha 2 release. 
	However, the set of functionalities is currently limited.
<P/>
	Additionally, while performance has also significantly improved, 
	it has not yet reached the desired level.
<p/>
	Please review the following Release Notes and provide your input on this release 
	by using the feedback mechanisms on the Backstage site. 
<P/>

<HR>
	<h4>Target Platforms and Devices</h4>
	The Bedrock Browser is released as a signed SIS package that can be installed on N97 devices. 
	We recommend using a CE device with the latest firmware patches, as opposed to an R & D prototype device.
<P/>
<HR>
	<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
	The Bedrock Release requires the following:
	<ul>
	<li>A Nokia N97 device, consumer version (CE) recommended. 
	(If you use this release on an R & D prototype device, it is at your own risk.)</li>
	<li>The latest platform software installed on the device. 
	This release has been tested with: N97 Software Version 12.0.024, dated 04/08/09</li>
	<li>You must install all of the provided software packages on your device's C: drive.</li>
	<li>You need a minimum of 11-12 MB of free space on the C: drive. 
	(HINT: Open the platform browser and clear the device's browser cache - this will free up a few MB.</li>
	<li>If your device has a previously-installed version of the Bedrock browser or the Qt framework, 
	you must remove them before proceeding.  
	Please review the installation notes for information about removing older components 
	from your device.</li>
	<li>The default network setup is required on the device. 
	The N97 connection settings must contain the default <em>Destination Network</em> of <em>"Internet"</em> 
	that contains the proper access points (APs). 
	The browser will connect to the network using this Internet Destination Network.
<br>
	<B>Important:</B> Ensure that the default access point 
	(as defined in the connection settings for the Destination Network) 
	is available when running the Bedrock browser.  
	There have been cases where an unavailable WLAN AP prevented loading of pages. </li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Functionality to Evaluate</h4>
	We encourage you to try out the following new features and let us know what you think!
	<ul>
	<li>Zooming:
	<ul>
	<li>Basic incremental zoom-in/zoom-out is available with the two zoom buttons on the lower toolbar.</li>
	<li>Double-tap "fit-to-block" zooming will zoom/focus in on a block of text or an image. 
	<br>Also, please try to give us feedback on Zooming out using a double-tap gesture.</li></ul> </li>
	<li>Viewport scaling: The browser now supports the meta tag options for setting the viewport 
	(display area) for the web page. See "Known Limitations" section for limitations/impacts. 
	Google "meta viewport" for details on this feature. If you know of sites that use this feature, 
	please try them with the browser.</li> 
	<li>Windows View: Tap the "Windows" button on the toolbar to open the windows manager and add a new window. 
	Then, return to switch between windows.</li>
	<li>GoToAnywhere View: Now includes Bookmarks, History, and Visual History. 
	Try adding a bookmark (it will add a bookmark to the current page in the content view).</li>
	<li>Session Restore: The browser will restore the previous session, including session history, 
	in each of any open windows. Try opening multiple windows and browsing multiple pages in each. 
	Then, exit the browser (red "end" key) and launch the browser again. 
	All of your windows and history should be restored!</li>
	<li>Standards Tests: The WebKit engine in this release has been updated 
	and is now doing a much better job on standards tests (like ACID3).</li>
	<li>Navi-key scrolling: The 4-way navi-key and middle "Select" key can now be used to scroll the page 
	and select items.</li>
	</ul>
	<HR>
	<h4>Known Limitations</h4> 
	<ul>
	<li>WebKit Performance: Although improved, there are a number of known issues with 
	the Qt WebKit used in this release of Bedrock. Some have a major impact on performance of the engine. 
	For example, rendering after a zoom-level change is known to be slow. See our wiki page for more details.</li> 
	<li>Out of Memory Handling: Handling of low memory conditions is not yet optimized for browsing large web pages.
	In some cases, loading large or image-intensive pages can cause the browser to lock-up or crash. 
	Please report the sites/pages to us if you experience this.</li> 
	<li>UI Performance: We are still evaluating and responding to performance issues. 
	When using this Alpha release, please be patient when performing actions. 
	Avoid quickly repeating actions if it seems there is a lack of response to an action. 
	Once a button or link is pressed, or a touch gesture is applied, 
	it may take some time for the resulting action to be reflected in the UI.  
	However, sometimes touch gestures are "lost" and you may need to repeat them to activate a  control.</li>
	<li>Adding a new window: When adding a new "blank" window from the Windows View, 
	the browser may (incorrectly) restore a previously open window instead of creating a new, blank window.</li>
	<li>Restoring Session: When launching the browser the previously open windows and pages will be restored. 
	If the pages that were previously open were large or in some way problematic for the browser, 
	restoring the session might restore those problems as well. 
	If any strange behavior is seen when restoring the last session, 
	try closing as many windows as possible and ensure that each window contains a "simple" page 
	(like Google's search page).</li>
	<li>Changing the browser orientation from landscape to portrait and vice-versa is better supported now, 
	but there are some known issues. For example, in any view that shows a page thumbnail, 
	that thumbnail is not updated to reflect the orientation change. 
	Also, entering text in portrait mode is "undefined" at this time - any virtual keyboard that might 
	come up has not been fully tested in that mode. We recommend using the hardware keyboard for text entry.</li>
	<li>Form input password fields: Character hiding IS supported when entering a password into a form field, 
	but this is actually problematic. Because no "preview" of the typed character is provided, 
	it is not possible to verify the character typed. Be sure you have the proper text entry mode 
	(lower case, all caps, mixed) set before entering a password.</li>
	<li>Secure page indication is now supported, but the indicator may not refresh properly 
	when switching between windows or moving back through history.</li>
	<li>HTTP authentication is supported but the masking of the characters 
	as the password is entered is not yet enabled. 
	Also, the HTTP authentication dialog has no "OK" button. 
	Press the hardware Enter key to submit the authentication.</li>
	<li>Form field input masking is not yet supported. 
	This can cause some form entry use cases to fail if the data entered is not formatted correctly.</li>
	<li>Text Prediction / T9 Issues: Please be sure that when entering any text into any edit field 
	(especially the URL entry box!) that text prediction is turned OFF.</li>
	<li>Viewport scaling is supported but in some cases will result in pages that are "clipped" 
	vertically on the page. If pages are not rendered properly (you can sometimes "see" 
	the previous page "under" the offending page) try changing the zoom level.</li>
	<li>File downloading is NOT yet supported. If you attempt to load content that 
	isn't rendered in the browser itself, it will NOT be downloaded. 
	So, for example, clicking a link to another HTML page will load/render that page. 
	Clicking a link to a JPG image will load that image into a page in the browser. 
	But clicking a link to a PDF, MP3, ZIP or other type of content file will not result in a download. 
	Nothing will happen.</li>
	<li>File uploading via the HTML form &lt;input type="file"... mechanism is NOT supported.</li>
	<li>The URL entry bar is now designed to "scroll off" the top of the view when the page is scrolled up. It has been noticed that sometimes the bar will not re-display after scrolling back up.</li>
	</ul>
